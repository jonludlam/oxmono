  "summary": "Makefile and configuration fixes for `for-pack` tag propagation to bytecode compilation",
  "details": "- **Makefile changes**: Split generic `%.cmo` and `%.cmi` pattern rules into directory-specific rules (`src/`, `bin/`, `plugin-lib/`) to ensure `src/` modules are compiled with `-for-pack Ocamlbuild_pack` flag for bytecode\n- **Configuration fix** (`src/configuration.ml`): Added logic to propagate `for-pack(...)` tags from `.cmx` files to corresponding `.ml` and `.mli` files, ensuring pack configuration applies consistently to both native and bytecode compilation\n- **Removed `.depend` file**: Generated dependency file removed from version control\n- **Included `flambda2.patch`**: Contains the same Makefile and configuration changes as a patch file"
