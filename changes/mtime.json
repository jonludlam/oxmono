  "summary": "Port from ocamlbuild/topkg to dune build system with reorganized source structure.",
  "details": "- Removed ocamlbuild files: `B0.ml`, `BRZO`, `_tags`, `myocamlbuild.ml`, `pkg/pkg.ml`, `pkg/META`, `.mllib` and `.clib` files\n- Added `dune-project` and `mtime.opam` files for dune-based builds\n- Added `dune` files in `src/`, `src/top/`, `src-clock/`, `test/`, and `doc/` directories\n- Reorganized clock implementation: moved from `src/clock/` to new `src-clock/` directory\n- The `mtime.clock.os` library now lives in `src-clock/` with proper dune configuration including C stubs and js_of_ocaml runtime\n- Added virtual `mtime.clock` library in `src/` (empty modules placeholder)\n- Added `Mtime_clock` interface file (`mtime_clock.mli`) in main `src/` directory for the virtual clock\n- Tests are defined but disabled (marked optional, runtest rules commented out) as they require the `b0` library"
