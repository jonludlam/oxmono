  "summary": "Remove OCaml version conditionals to always use Dynarray-based implementation",
  "details": "- Removes `enabled_if (>= %{ocaml_version} \"5.2\")` conditionals from dune rules\n- Removes fallback rules for OCaml versions prior to 5.2 that used the `vector` library\n- Always uses `pvector.dynarray.ml` implementation instead of conditionally selecting between dynarray and vector backends\n- Removes dependency on external `vector` library for older OCaml versions"
