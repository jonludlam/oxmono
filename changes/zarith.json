  "summary": "Add dune build support and OxCaml portability annotations for arbitrary-precision integer library",
  "details": "- **Dune build support**: Added `dune`, `dune-project`, and `tests/dune` files with build rules that run the upstream configure script and extract compiler flags\n- **OxCaml portability annotations**: Added `@@ portable` annotations to all external C functions in `z.ml` and `z.mli`\n- **Immutable data jkind**: Changed `type t` to `type t : immutable_data` in both `Z` and `Q` modules\n- **Local mode support**: Added `local_` annotations to input parameters (`of_int32`, `of_int64`, `of_float`, `of_string`, etc.) and added `compare__local`/`equal__local` variants in `Q` module\n- **Global field annotations**: Added `global_` annotations to `Q.t` record fields (`num`, `den`)\n- **Safe callback registration**: Changed `Callback.register_exception` to `Callback.Safe.register_exception`\n- **Configure script improvements**: Added Windows (MSVC/mingw) platform detection for proper object/library/dll suffixes; now generates `Makefile.config` instead of `Makefile`; bumped minimum OCaml version to 4.07\n- **Opam improvements**: Added homebrew arm64 configure support; added `conf-pkg-config` dependency; version bumped to 1.14+ox\n- **Q.abs optimization**: Avoids allocation when the number is already non-negative\n- **Discover script**: Added `discover.ml` for platform-specific GMP library detection (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, macOS/Homebrew)"
